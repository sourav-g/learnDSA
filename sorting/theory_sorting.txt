Hybrid Sorting algorithms :

TimSort (in python)
-------------------
uses merge and insertion sort. switches to insertion sort when
array becomes small

IntroSort
---------
uses heap,quick,insertion sort. switches to insertion sort when
array becomes small

-> Merge sort used in many standard library implementations
-> Java 8 uses merge and quick sort depending on the input type
